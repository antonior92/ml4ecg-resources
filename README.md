# Machine learning for ECG resources

A list of machine learning for ECG interpretation resources
developed by collaborators and me.

## Implementations (with models)


### Preprocessing

- Preprocessing for deep learning
  - https://github.com/antonior92/ecg-preprocessing
  


### Traditional tasks

These are tasks that a cardiologist can do.

- Classification of abnormal ECGs
  - https://github.com/antonior92/automatic-ecg-diagnosis
  


### AI-enabled tasks

These are not well estabilished tasks within traditional electrocardiography,
but that can be developed with the help of AI.

- Chagas prediction

- Electrolyte concentration prediction
  - https://github.com/philippvb/ecg-electrolyte-regression
  

- Age prediction

## Datasets



- CODE: an annotated 12-lead ECG dataset containing exams from more than a million patients
  - [ https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.15169716 ]( https://doi.org/10.17044/scilifelab.15169716 ) 
  - **available for research upon request**
  - *Dataset with annotated 12-lead ECG records. The exams were taken in 811 counties in the state of Minas Gerais/Brazil by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (TNMG) between 2010 and 2016. And organized by the CODE (Clinical outcomes in digital electrocardiography) group.*

- CODE-test: an 12-lead ECG dataset annotated by multiple experts
  - [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3765780 ]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3765780 ) 
  - **openly available**
  - *Annotated 12 lead ECG dataset. Contain 827 ECG tracings from different patients, annotated by several cardiologists, residents  and medical students.*

- CODE-15%: a large scale annotated dataset of 12-lead ECGs
  - [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4916206 ]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4916206 ) 
  - **openly available**
  - *A dataset of 12-lead ECGs with annotations. The dataset contains 345 779 exams from 233 770 patients. It was obtained through stratified sampling from the CODE dataset ( 15% of the patients). The data was collected by the Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais in the period between 2010 and 2016.*

- SaMi-Trop: 12-lead ECG traces with age and mortality annotations
  - [ https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4905618 ]( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4905618 ) 
  - **openly available**
  - *SaMi-Trop is an NIH-funded prospective cohort of 1959 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy to evaluate whether a clinical prediction rule based on ECG, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and other biomarkers can be useful in clinical practice. A subset of the SaMi-Trop dataset with annotations of age and mortality and the correspondent ECG traces is openly available here.*
